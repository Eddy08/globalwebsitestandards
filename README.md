# Global Website Standards
What are the different Website Standards that are being used in Websites related to different set of Industries & Regions Around the Globe & their Acts:
Example:
1. (industry) Health Industry
2. (region) EU
3. (act) HIPAA
We want to create a graph network interconnecting all of these to show intersection, union, substitution etc.
